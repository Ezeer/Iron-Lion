# Iron-Lion
Game made from a directX sample (XACTGame )

The purpose is to learn the DirectX Sdk step by step , through a little game .
But also to practice some cool stuff , like AI , Physics , Networking , Audio etc ...
The goal being to study the case of a complete Game engine .

************************
Why Iron-Lion as title ?

Because that demo context is in an arena , with iron bots as opponents . 
So the player will have to be like a lion front of these iron(ic) behaviors... lol
